# Python-Recipe_Search

This program allows users to search for recipes using the Edamam Recipe API based on ingredients they have. Users can enter an ingredient, and the program will display a list of recipes that include that ingredient. It also provides options to save the search results to a file and to perform a nutrition analysis of a selected recipe.

### Prerequisites

Before you can use the program, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Additionally, you should have the `requests`, `json`, `termcolor`, and `tabulate` libraries installed. You can install these using pip:

## Features

- Save Search Results: You can save the search results to a text file.
- Nutrition Analysis: Select a recipe from the search results and get a detailed nutrition analysis.
- Save Selected Recipe: Save the selected recipe and its nutrition information to a separate file.
